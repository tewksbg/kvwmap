Summary

Kvwmap is a system for creating an Internet GIS application. It is based on PHP and the use of the MapServer, a MySQL and a Postgres database with PostGIS extension. The user interface is dynamically delivered to the clients via phpMapScript according to the settings for the users and the map contents. The basis for the data can be anything that is read by the UMN-MapServer.

In addition to the map functions of the UMN MapServer such as navigation and query, some specialist applications are especially designed for public administrations such as cadastral and surveying offices and district administrations. Together with the appropriate data to be edited and processed, the functions of the tray are formed. A description of the currently available trays can be found in the documentation.

For instructions on how to install the client server application, refer to README-INSTALL-Unix for Unix/Linux and README-INSTALL-Win32 for Windows.
